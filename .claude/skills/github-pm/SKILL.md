  This skill should be used when the user mentions tickets, issues, backlog,
  PR, pull request, worktree, sprint, or any development project management
  activity. Also activate when the user says "create issue", "work on #N",
  "close ticket", "open PR", "merge PR", "view backlog", "create branch for
  issue", or when code was modified without a linked issue.

# GitHub PM — issue lifecycle and Projects v2

You are the PM orchestrator for GitHub projects. Your role is to ensure
that all code work is linked to an issue, that the Projects v2 status
reflects the real state, and that no code goes to main without CI and review.

## Mandatory precondition

Before any Projects v2 operation, read `.claude/pm-config.json`:

```bash
cat .claude/pm-config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

If it returns `NOT_FOUND`, instruct the user to run `/pm:setup-project` and stop.
Never try to infer project_id or status_field_id — use only the IDs from the file.

The second precondition is OAuth scope. Every workflow below calls
`gh api graphql` against Projects v2, which needs `project` — a scope the token
minted by a plain `gh auth login` does not carry. When any `gh` command fails
with "token has not been granted the required scopes", "requires the following
scopes", or "Resource not accessible by personal access token", that is a
missing scope, not a bug in the query. Stop and give the user:

```bash
gh auth refresh -h github.com -s admin:public_key,gist,project,read:org,repo,workflow
```

Never set `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN` or suggest a personal access token from the
GitHub web UI as a workaround — a fine-grained PAT additionally lacks
`Checks: Read`, which breaks `gh pr checks` in a way that looks unrelated.

## Lifecycle

8 states on the board: `Triage, Backlog, Todo, Ready, In Progress, In Review, Blocked, Done`.

**Automated** (3 of the 4 workflows in `.github/workflows/` call the guarded
`pm-status-update` composite action so they never regress a status a human or a later
stage already set; the 4th (`issue-to-project.yml`) sets the initial Triage status directly
via `github/update-project-action@v4`, since a brand-new item has no prior status to regress
from):

```
Triage (issue opened) → In Progress (commit) → In Review (PR opened) → Done (PR merged)
```

**Human-curated** (never touched by automation — move issues between these, and out of
`Triage`, by hand or via `/pm:*` commands): `Backlog`, `Todo`, `Ready`, `Blocked`.

Never skip a state. Never regress a status (e.g.: In Review stays In Review if a new
commit is made while the PR is open; a merge always wins even over Blocked).

## Delegation map

For issue CRUD (create, list, edit, close, sub-issues, fields, Projects v2):
→ Use the `github-issues` skill. It provides MCP tools (`mcp__github__projects_write`,
  `mcp__github__search_issues`, etc.) that already cover everything. Do not reinvent this CRUD.

For troubleshooting a blocked PR, failing CI, branch protection, conflicts:
→ Use the `github-project` skill. It covers diagnosis and resolution of these cases.

For worktrees, branches, commits, push: native git + gh CLI.

For reading pm-config.json: local reference `references/pm-config-schema.md`.

## Available workflows

| Trigger | Reference |
| ------- | ---------- |
| "create ticket", "new bug", "new feature", "new task" | `references/01-create-issue.md` |
| "work on #N", "pick up #N", "create worktree for #N" | `references/02-work-issue.md` |
| "close #N", "complete", "mark as done" | `references/03-close-issue.md` |
| "backlog", "what is pending", "list issues", "what needs to be done" | `references/04-backlog.md` |

Load the relevant reference before responding. Each reference has the complete
step-by-step — do not invent an alternative flow.

## Principles

1. All code work must have an issue. If there is none → create one retroactively before continuing.
2. Confirm with the user before creating or closing issues.
3. Status reflects real state. Never leave In Progress if work has stopped.
4. NEVER operate on `main` — always on a feature branch or worktree.
5. NEVER merge without the `check-pr-status.mjs` gate with exit 0 (or exit 4/5 + confirmation).
   Exit 5 means CI and `reviewDecision` are fine but unresolved review-thread comments or
   pending review requests remain — the only way a `COMMENTED` bot review (Codex, Claude
   Code, etc.) surfaces, since it never sets `reviewDecision`.
6. NEVER use `--admin` bypass without explicit request and double confirmation.

## Anti-patterns

- Do not close an issue without validating acceptance criteria in the issue body.
- Do not create a worktree from `main` without `-b <branch>`.
- Do not merge without green CI (scripts/check-pr-status.mjs).
- Do not remove a worktree with uncommitted code (scripts/worktree-safety-check.mjs).
