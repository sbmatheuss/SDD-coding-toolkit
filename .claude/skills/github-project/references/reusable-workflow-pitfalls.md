# Reusable Workflow Pitfalls

Operational and structural pitfalls when authoring reusable workflows and the composite actions they use. Distinct from `reusable-workflow-security.md` — that doc covers supply-chain trust and SHA pinning of *external* actions; this doc covers structural traps that have bitten in practice when building *internal* reusable workflows.

## 1. `./` does NOT resolve to the reusable workflow's repo

When a workflow is invoked via `workflow_call`, references like `uses: ./.github/actions/foo` are resolved against the **consumer's** workspace, not the reusable workflow's repo. The action will fail to load unless the consumer happens to have an identically-named local action.

GitHub documents this directly: "Local actions in workflows that are called as a reusable workflow are not supported." (See [Reusing workflows — limitations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows#limitations).)

To call a composite action from a reusable workflow, reference it absolutely:

```yaml
# In the reusable workflow:
uses: org/repo/.github/actions/foo@<sha>   # works (absolute reference)
# uses: ./.github/actions/foo              # FAILS at the consumer
```

## 2. Composite-action references must be SHA-pinned

Internal `@main` references are accepted for **full reusable workflows** (`uses: org/repo/.github/workflows/foo.yml@main`) — see `reusable-workflow-security.md`. But **composite actions** (`uses: org/repo/.github/actions/foo@main`) are different: the consumer's runner resolves them under the consumer's allow-list policy. A consumer enforcing "all actions must be SHA-pinned" will reject the reusable workflow's job entirely, even though the reusable workflow file itself is unchanged.

This is enforced mechanically by checkpoint **GH-34**.

```yaml
# Inside a reusable workflow:
- uses: org/repo/.github/actions/preflight-gate@<40-char-sha>   # OK
# - uses: org/repo/.github/actions/preflight-gate@main          # breaks SHA-pinned consumers
```

When you self-reference a composite action inside the same repo that hosts the reusable workflow, you create a chicken-and-egg: the SHA you pin to must already exist in the same PR you're authoring. Two options: (a) inline the action's body as bash steps directly in the workflow (avoiding the cross-action `uses:`), or (b) land the composite action first, then SHA-pin to it in a follow-up PR.

## 3. `gh run rerun` caches `@ref` resolution

When a workflow run is created, GitHub records the resolved SHAs of every `uses: org/repo/...@ref` at that moment. **Re-running the same run replays those exact SHAs** — it does not re-evaluate the refs. This means: if you fix a bug in an upstream reusable workflow and merge the fix, then re-run a failed workflow that consumed `@main`, you will get the **old, broken** body.

To pick up upstream changes after merging the fix:

- Push a new commit to the PR (`git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger ci"` works), or
- Close + reopen the PR, or
- Trigger a fresh `workflow_dispatch` run.

`gh run rerun` is fine for genuinely transient failures (network blips, rate limits) — not for "I fixed the upstream reusable workflow."

## 4. Permissions ceiling — caller cannot grant what it lacks

A reusable workflow's `permissions:` block sets the **maximum** scopes the called job is allowed to use. The actual token issued is the **intersection** of the caller's job-level `permissions:` and the reusable workflow's declared `permissions:`. If the calling job sets `permissions: {}` (empty), the reusable job receives a token with **zero** scopes regardless of what the reusable workflow declares.

When a reusable workflow gains a new requirement (e.g., a step that calls `gh api` and needs `actions: read`), every consumer's calling job must also be updated to grant that scope. Otherwise the new step fails with a 403 in production but works in your test repo where you happen to have broader permissions.

```yaml
# Consumer side — must include EVERY scope the reusable workflow needs:
jobs:
    call-shared:
        permissions:
            contents: read
            actions: read           # required by the reusable workflow's gh api step
            pull-requests: write
        uses: org/ci-workflows/.github/workflows/shared.yml@<sha>
```

See [GitHub docs — access and permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows#access-and-permissions) for the full intersection rules.

> **See also:** [`reusable-workflow-security.md`](./reusable-workflow-security.md) for SHA-pinning and supply-chain trust of *external* actions.

## 5. Inline `config_data` overrides the repo's own config file

Linter actions that accept an inline `config_data:` (e.g. yamllint via a
reusable workflow) **replace** the consumer repo's own config file entirely —
they do not merge. A repo with a carefully tuned `.yamllint.yml` (ignore paths,
relaxed rules) silently has all of it discarded the moment the reusable workflow
passes its own inline defaults.

Provide inline defaults only as a *fallback*, when the repo has no config of its own:

```yaml
- name: Provide default config if the repo has none
  run: |
    if [[ ! -f .yamllint.yml ]]; then
      cat > .yamllint.yml <<'EOF'
    extends: default
    rules: { line-length: disable }
    EOF
    fi
- name: Lint
  uses: some/yamllint-action@<sha>   # picks up the repo's config, or the fallback
```

## 6. Fix the gap in the shared workflow, not per-project

When CI or quality logic lives in a shared reusable workflow (e.g. `netresearch/typo3-ci-*`), a gap or bug that surfaces in one consumer is almost always a gap in the **shared** workflow. Fix it upstream so every consumer inherits the fix — do not patch the single project's `.github/workflows/`.

Per-project patches defeat the point of the reusable workflow: they reintroduce the duplication the shared workflow exists to remove, drift out of sync as the shared workflow evolves, and force the same fix to be rediscovered in the next repo.

Before adding a guard, check, or fix to a project's own workflow files, ask whether the shared reusable-workflow repo already owns that concern — or should. If it does, land the change there and let the consumer pick it up via its `@main` / `@vX.Y.Z` reference (per [`reusable-workflow-security.md`](./reusable-workflow-security.md), internal reusable workflows are referenced by tag/branch, not SHA). Keep logic in a consumer only when it is genuinely project-specific.

This is distinct from pitfalls #1–#5 above (which cover *how* to author and reference reusable workflows) — this is about *where* a fix belongs.
