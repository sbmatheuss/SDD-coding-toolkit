# Merge Strategy for Signed Commits

This guide explains how to configure GitHub repositories that require both signed commits and clean git history.

## The Problem

GitHub's branch protection offers two relevant settings that conflict:

| Setting | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `required_signatures` | All commits on protected branch must be signed |
| `required_linear_history` | Only squash or rebase merges allowed (no merge commits) |

**The conflict:** GitHub cannot sign commits during squash or rebase merge operations. When `required_linear_history` is enabled, GitHub rewrites commits server-side, but cannot sign them with your GPG/SSH key.

## The Solution

Use **local rebase + merge commit**:

1. Developers rebase their PR branch locally (signing commits with their key)
2. Force-push the rebased branch
3. Merge via merge commit (GitHub signs the merge commit with its key)

This gives you:
- ✅ Clean, linear history on feature branches
- ✅ Clear merge points on main branch
- ✅ All commits verified (developers sign feature commits, GitHub signs merge commits)

## Repository Settings

Configure via API:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} -X PATCH \
  -f allow_merge_commit=true \
  -f allow_rebase_merge=true \
  -f allow_squash_merge=false
```

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `allow_merge_commit` | `true` | Required for signed commits workflow |
| `allow_rebase_merge` | `true` | GitHub requires at least one of squash/rebase |
| `allow_squash_merge` | `false` | Destroys individual commit history and signatures |

**Note:** GitHub requires at least one of `allow_squash_merge` or `allow_rebase_merge` to be true. Keep `allow_rebase_merge` enabled but don't use it for PRs requiring signatures.

## Branch Protection Settings

Configure via API:

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection -X PUT \
  --input - << 'EOF'
{
  "required_status_checks": {
    "strict": true,
    "contexts": ["ci"]
  },
  "enforce_admins": true,
  "required_pull_request_reviews": {
    "required_approving_review_count": 1
  },
  "restrictions": null,
  "required_linear_history": false,
  "required_signatures": true,
  "required_conversation_resolution": true
}
EOF
```

| Setting | Value | Reason |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `required_signatures` | `true` | Enforces signed commits |
| `required_linear_history` | `false` | **Must be false** - blocks merge commits |
| `required_conversation_resolution` | `true` | All review threads must be resolved before merge |

## Developer Workflow

### Before Opening PR

```bash
# Ensure commits are signed
git config commit.gpgsign true
```

### Before Merging

```bash
# 1. Fetch latest main
git fetch origin

# 2. Rebase on main (re-signs commits)
git rebase origin/main

# 3. Force-push rebased branch
git push --force-with-lease
```

### Merging

```bash
# Use merge commit strategy
gh pr merge <number> --merge
```

## Auto-Merge Configuration

Auto-merge works with signed commits **only when using merge commit strategy**.

| Strategy | Compatible | Reason |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Merge commit | ✅ | GitHub signs merge commit with its key |
| Rebase | ❌ | GitHub cannot sign rewritten commits |
| Squash | ❌ | GitHub cannot sign squashed commit |

When configuring auto-merge workflows, ensure they use `--merge`:

```yaml
- name: Enable auto-merge
  run: gh pr merge --auto --merge "$PR_NUMBER"
```

## How GitHub Signing Works

When you merge via the GitHub UI or API with merge commit:

1. **Feature branch commits**: Retain original GPG/SSH signatures from developers
2. **Merge commit**: Signed by GitHub's web-flow key (`noreply@github.com`)

Both are marked as "Verified" in the GitHub UI:
- Developer commits show the developer's GPG key
- Merge commits show "Verified" with GitHub as the signer

## Troubleshooting

### "Merge commits are not allowed on this repository"

**Cause:** `allow_merge_commit` is false in repository settings.

**Fix:**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo} -X PATCH -f allow_merge_commit=true
```

### "Base branch requires signed commits. Rebase merges cannot be automatically signed"

**Cause:** `required_linear_history` is true, forcing rebase merge which GitHub cannot sign.

**Fix:**
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/branches/main/protection -X PUT \
  --input - << 'EOF'
{
  ...existing settings...,
  "required_linear_history": false
}
EOF
```

### Auto-merge fails with signature error

**Cause:** Auto-merge configured with rebase or squash strategy.

**Fix:** Update auto-merge workflow to use `--merge` flag instead of `--rebase` or `--squash`.

### Rulesets cannot block merge on a pending review

Neither branch protection nor rulesets support "block merge while any requested reviewer hasn't submitted yet". The options available are adjacent but not equivalent:

| Setting | What it does | Not what you want |
|---|---|---|
| `required_approving_review_count: 1` | Needs **one approval** | Doesn't wait for other requested reviewers |
| `required_review_thread_resolution: true` | Blocks on **unresolved threads** | Doesn't block before any thread is created |

If you need to hold merge until Copilot (or any other requested reviewer) has actually posted its review, the workaround is a custom GitHub Actions status check that queries pending reviewers and fails if any are outstanding — then require that check in branch protection.

```bash
# Example: fail the check if any reviewer — user or team — is still requested.
pending=$(gh api "repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR" \
  --jq '((.requested_reviewers // []) | length) + ((.requested_teams // []) | length)')
if [[ "$pending" -gt 0 ]]; then
  echo "::error::Still waiting on $pending review request(s) (user/team)"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Renaming a CI job orphans its required status check → PR stuck "Expected"

Required status checks are matched by **exact context name**. Renaming a job — including changing a **matrix value** that appears in the job name (e.g. `PHPStan (8.2, ^14.0)` → `PHPStan (8.2, ^14.3)`) — produces a *new* context name. The old required context no longer reports, so it sits "Expected — Waiting for status to be reported" forever and the PR is `BLOCKED`, even though every job is green.

This is a silent trap: the CI change looks self-contained, but the required-checks list in branch protection / the ruleset still names the old job. Treat the required-checks list as a declared value that must be swept whenever a job name changes.

```bash
# After renaming any matrixed/required job, update the ruleset's contexts.
# Rulesets (PUT the full ruleset; required_status_checks is nested under rules):
gh api "repos/$REPO/rulesets/$ID" > /tmp/rs.json    # back up first
# edit the .rules[] required_status_checks[].context entries, then:
gh api -X PUT "repos/$REPO/rulesets/$ID" --input /tmp/rs.json

# Classic branch protection: this endpoint REPLACES the entire contexts list,
# so you must send ALL required contexts (renamed + unchanged), or you silently
# drop the others. Read the current list, swap the renamed entries, send it back.
gh api "repos/$REPO/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks" \
  --jq '{strict: .strict, contexts: .contexts}' \
  | jq '.contexts |= map(sub("\\^14\\.0"; "^14.3"))' > /tmp/rsc.json
gh api -X PATCH "repos/$REPO/branches/main/protection/required_status_checks" --input /tmp/rsc.json
```

Verify the contexts match the jobs the workflow now emits. The context string is the **check-run name** from `repos/$REPO/commits/$SHA/check-runs[].name`, which for reusable-/multi-job workflows includes the `workflow / job (matrix)` prefix (e.g. `ci / PHPStan (8.2, ^14.3)`) — not the bare job name. (This is the same source `init-branch-protection.sh` uses; the `/actions/runs/{id}/jobs` endpoint returns the bare job name and is wrong for context matching.)

### Merge queue silently fails to enqueue a green PR

On a repo with a `merge_queue` ruleset rule, an all-green PR with auto-merge armed (`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`) sometimes never enters the queue — no queue entry, no `merge_group` build, it just sits OPEN. Confirm it is genuinely stuck before acting:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='query($owner:String!,$repo:String!,$branch:String!){
  repository(owner:$owner,name:$repo){
    mergeQueue(branch:$branch){entries(first:10){nodes{pullRequest{number} state position}}}
  }
}' -f owner=OWNER -f repo=REPO -f branch=main \
  --jq '.data.repository.mergeQueue?.entries?.nodes[]? // empty'
gh run list --repo OWNER/REPO --event merge_group -L 5   # any build for this PR?
```

If there is no entry and no `merge_group` run after the required checks have passed, admin-merge with the queue's configured method (preserves signatures with `--merge`):

```bash
gh pr merge <PR> --repo OWNER/REPO --merge --admin
```
