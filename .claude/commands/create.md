## Task

This command starts a new application creation process.

### Steps:

2. **Project Planning**
   - Use `project-planner` agent for task breakdown
   - Determine tech stack
   - Plan file structure
   - Create the `{task-slug}.md` plan file in the project root, then proceed to building

3. **Application Building (After Approval)**
   - Orchestrate with `app-builder` skill
   - Coordinate expert agents:
     - `database-architect` → Schema
     - `backend-specialist` → API
     - `frontend-specialist` → UI

4. **Preview**
   - Start with `auto_preview.py` when complete
   - Present URL to user

- Who will use it?

Use defaults, add details later.
