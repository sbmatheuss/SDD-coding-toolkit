Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
Status: !`git status --short`
Diff: !`git diff HEAD --stat`
Config PM: !`cat .claude/pm-config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"`

Use the `github-pm` skill to execute this workflow.

**Worktree-safe execution:** run every `git`/`gh` command below as its own separate,
plain Bash call — never chain two of them with `&&`, `;`, or `$(...)` command
substitution. Per the [official worktree docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/worktrees#how-claude-code-enforces-isolation),
Claude Code blocks any Bash command that redirects git into the main checkout —
`git -C`, `--git-dir`, a `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` variable, or a `cd` into the
main checkout before running git — plus, separately, any command it can't
otherwise verify stays inside the worktree ("too complex to verify that it stays
inside the worktree"). This file never needs `git -C`: every step below already
targets whatever checkout the session is currently in. Each step below is
already written as one command per code block for this reason — keep it that
way, including when a step has two consecutive code blocks (run them as two
separate Bash calls, not pasted together).

1. Branch gate — never commit onto `main`/`master`. If the current branch is
   `main` or `master`, automatically create a fresh branch for the pending
   changes and switch to it before committing:
   - Name it from the change you are about to commit (same conventional-commit
     type + a kebab slug of the subject): `<type>/<slug>`, max 60 chars
     (e.g. `fix/version-from-plugin-json`). If an issue number is already known
     from context, prefix it: `<type>/<N>-<slug>`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <branch>
   ```

   Then continue the workflow on this new branch (use it as `<BRANCH>` below).
   If already on a non-main branch, use it as-is. The PR's base branch does not
   need to be computed here — step 5 lets `gh pr create` resolve it on its own.

2. Analyze `git diff HEAD` to generate a commit message (conventional commits):
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - chore: maintenance/infra
   - docs: documentation
   - refactor: refactoring without behavior change
   - test: tests

3. Commit immediately — do not ask for confirmation. Two separate commands,
   run one at a time (not joined by `&&`):

   ```bash
   git add -A
   ```

   ```bash
   git commit -m "<generated message>"
   ```

4. Push. `-u` both creates the upstream tracking branch on the first push and is
   a safe, idempotent no-op re-run on later pushes, so no `||` fallback command
   is needed:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin <BRANCH>
   ```

5. Detect the issue from the branch name — the branch you created in step 1 if
   the gate fired, otherwise the `Current branch` value from the dynamic context
   above (that value was captured before step 1, so it is stale if the gate
   created a new branch). Take the first `[0-9]+` match: `feat/42-*` or `42-*`
   → issue #42. Optionally verify it:

   ```bash
   gh issue view <N> --json number,title
   ```

   Create the PR with "Closes #N" in the body if an issue was detected. Omit
   `--base` entirely — `gh pr create` already defaults it to the repository's
   real default branch, so there is nothing to compute or hardcode. (The old
   `BASE=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD@{upstream} ...)` fallback was worse
   than useless: `@{upstream}` is the current branch's tracking ref, not the
   PR target, and its `sed 's|.*/||'` mangles any branch name containing `/`.)

   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<title based on commit>" --body "<body with Closes #N>"
   ```

6. Report the PR URL. Suggest: "Run `/pm:code-review-pr <PR>` to start the review."

7. Ask via the **AskUserQuestion** tool whether to merge now — question
   "Merge this PR now?", options "Merge now (`/pm:pr-merge <N>`)" and "Not yet".
   If they choose to merge → run the `/pm:pr-merge <N>` workflow with `<N>` = the
   PR number from step 5.
