description: Safely merge a PR — validates CI before merging
argument-hint: "[pr-or-issue-number]"

Config PM: !`cat .claude/pm-config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"`
Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

Use the `github-pm` skill to execute the safe merge. The `$ARGUMENTS`
argument can be a PR number or an issue number.

**Worktree-safe execution:** run every `git`/`gh` command below as its own
separate, plain Bash call — never chain two of them with `&&`, `;`, or `$(...)`
command substitution. Per the [official worktree docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/worktrees#how-claude-code-enforces-isolation),
Claude Code blocks any Bash command that redirects git into the main checkout —
`git -C`, `--git-dir`, a `GIT_DIR`/`GIT_WORK_TREE` variable, or a `cd` into the
main checkout before running git — plus, separately, any command it can't
otherwise verify stays inside the worktree. This file never needs `git -C`:
every step below already targets whatever checkout the session is currently in
(Step 7 explicitly branches on "in a worktree" vs. "on the main checkout" rather
than redirecting into one from the other). Every `<PLACEHOLDER>` below is a
value **you** substitute literally into the command before running it — never a
shell variable. A shell variable does not survive from one Bash call to the
next, so `gh pr merge $PR_NUMBER $MERGE_FLAG --delete-branch` with both unset
silently degrades to `gh pr merge --delete-branch`, which merges whatever PR the
current branch happens to point at, with the default strategy. (`$ARGUMENTS`
above is a Claude Code command placeholder, substituted textually by the loader
before the shell ever runs — a separate mechanism from the guard described
above, not a confirmed exemption from it.)

**NEVER skip the gates below. This is the mandatory sequence:**

**Step 1 — Identify PR**

- Try directly as a PR number: `gh pr view $ARGUMENTS --json number`
- If it fails: treat the argument as an issue number and look for a PR whose
  branch is `<N>-*` or `<type>/<N>-*`, or whose body closes `#<N>`. Substitute
  `<N>` literally in **both** places below — do not write `$ARGUMENTS` inside
  the jq program, where a stray quote in the argument would break the quoting
  and inject into the program itself. `gh`'s built-in `--jq` does this in one
  process; do not pipe into `python3`, which stock Windows shadows with an App
  Execution Alias stub that opens the Microsoft Store instead of running
  anything. Prints the PR number, or nothing when there is no match:

  ```bash
  gh pr list --json number,headRefName,body --jq '[.[] | select((.headRefName | test("(^|/)<N>-")) or ((.body // "") | test("#<N>([^0-9]|$)")))] | first | .number // empty'
  ```

  The `([^0-9]|$)` boundary matters: a plain `#<N>` substring test matches
  `#420` while looking for issue 42, which would hand the wrong PR to the
  merge below. `.body // ""` covers a PR whose body is JSON `null` rather than
  an empty string.

**Step 2 — Check draft status**

```bash
gh pr view <PR_NUMBER> --json isDraft --jq '.isDraft'
```

If true → ask via the **AskUserQuestion** tool ("PR is a draft — mark it
ready?", options "Mark ready" / "Keep as draft, stop"). If they choose to mark
it ready:

```bash
gh pr ready <PR_NUMBER>
```

Then wait for CI: `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch`

**Step 3 — Authoritative gate (ALWAYS run, NEVER skip)**

```bash
node .claude/skills/github-pm/scripts/check-pr-status.mjs <PR_NUMBER> <OWNER>/<REPO>
```

- Exit 0 → proceed
- Exit 1 → BLOCK. List failures, do not merge.
- Exit 2 → ask via **AskUserQuestion** ("CI still running — wait for it?", options "Wait" / "Stop"); if Wait → `gh pr checks <PR_NUMBER> --watch`, then re-run the gate
- Exit 3 → STOP (invalid PR)
- Exit 4 → warn "CI green but no approved review". Ask via **AskUserQuestion** ("Merge without an approved review?", options "Merge anyway" / "Stop") before any merge.
- Exit 5 → CI green and reviewDecision is fine (APPROVED/none required), but the gate
  found pending code review activity that `reviewDecision` alone misses: unresolved
  review-thread comments and/or reviewers who were requested but haven't submitted yet.
  This is how bot reviewers (Codex, Claude Code, and most AI reviewers) usually show up —
  they post a `COMMENTED` review, which never sets `reviewDecision`, but still leave
  unresolved feedback. Relay exactly what the script printed (who left unresolved
  comments, who hasn't reviewed yet), then ask via **AskUserQuestion** ("PR has pending
  code review issues — fix them first?", options "Fix first (e.g. `/orchestrate`)" /
  "Merge anyway").

**Step 4 — Detect merge strategy**

This prints one of `--squash` / `--rebase` / `--merge`. That printed string is
`<MERGE_FLAG>` in Step 5 — substitute it literally there.

```bash
gh repo view --json squashMergeAllowed,rebaseMergeAllowed,mergeCommitAllowed --jq 'if .squashMergeAllowed then "--squash" elif .rebaseMergeAllowed then "--rebase" else "--merge" end'
```

**Step 5 — Merge**

```bash
gh pr merge <PR_NUMBER> <MERGE_FLAG> --delete-branch
```

If exit ≠ 0 → report the exact error, STOP without post-merge.

**Step 6 — Post-merge (only if merge exit 0)**

- Comment on the issue: "PR #<PR_NUMBER> merged ✅"
- Close the issue: `gh issue close <ISSUE_NUMBER> --repo <OWNER>/<REPO>`
- Move to Done in Projects v2 (use pm-config.json)

**Step 7 — Cleanup**

- If in a worktree → ask via **AskUserQuestion** ("Remove the worktree now?", options "Remove (`/pm:worktree-remove`)" / "Keep it")
- If on the main checkout, refresh it with two separate Bash calls (not joined
  by `&&`), where `<DEFAULT_BRANCH>` is the repository's default branch — `main`
  on most repos, `master` on older ones:

  ```bash
  git checkout <DEFAULT_BRANCH>
  ```

  ```bash
  git pull --ff-only
  ```

CRITICAL RULES (never violate):

- NEVER `gh pr merge` without the Step 3 gate with exit 0 (or exit 4/5 + explicit confirmation)
- NEVER close the issue before confirming merge exit 0
- NEVER `--admin` without explicit request + double confirmation
