  Work on a GitHub issue: set In Progress + worktree
argument-hint: "[issue-number]"
---

Issue: !`gh issue view $ARGUMENTS --json number,title,labels,body 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"`
Config PM: !`cat .claude/pm-config.json 2>/dev/null || echo "NOT_FOUND"`
Existing worktrees: !`git worktree list 2>/dev/null`

Use the `github-pm` skill to execute the start work workflow (Workflow 2).
Issue number: `$ARGUMENTS`.

The skill will:

1. Read issue details
2. Suggest a branch name (type/N-slug)
3. Create a worktree in .claude/worktrees/
4. Move the issue to In Progress in Projects v2
5. Comment on the issue

## After completing the issue setup

Once the worktree is created and the issue is In Progress, invoke the
`superpowers:brainstorming` skill passing the full issue context:

```text
Issue #<N>: <title>
Labels: <labels>
Body:
<body>

Goal: generate a detailed implementation plan with technical approach,
architecture, files to create/modify, edge cases, and execution order.
```

The skill will produce a structured plan. Present the plan to the user and ask
for approval via the **AskUserQuestion** tool ("Proceed with this plan?",
options "Approve — start implementation" / "Revise the plan"). Do not start
implementation until approved.

**When the user approves the plan**, use the `superpowers:writing-plans`
skill to record the plan, then augment each task with `Files:` (paths/globs
touched) and `Depends-on:` (task numbers, or `none`) tags. Execute the plan
via the `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` skill using the parallel
wave protocol in `.claude/rules/08-parallel-subagent-driven-development.md`:
batch independent tasks — disjoint `Files`, no mutual dependency — into waves
dispatched in parallel, and fall back to serial execution for any task left
untagged or uncertain (no regression).
