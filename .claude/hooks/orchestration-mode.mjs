/**
 * UserPromptSubmit hook that injects a standing "orchestration mode"
 * directive on every prompt: run the session as orchestrator, delegate
 * exploration/implementation to subagents, set `model` explicitly per
 * dispatch, and parallelize independent work. Delivered as a hook rather
 * than CLAUDE.md content because CLAUDE.md loses attention over a long
 * session — re-injecting it on every turn keeps the directive live
 * regardless of session length or context compaction.
 *
 * Injection is unconditional: no filesystem check, no project-type gating,
 * no caching, no session flag. Pure context injection (additionalContext
 * only, never a permission decision), so it never blocks a session.
 *
 * Cross-platform: plain Node (no shell), wired exec-form (`node <path>`) in
 * .claude/settings.json under UserPromptSubmit, no matcher (fires on every
 * prompt).
 *
 * Fails open on any I/O or parse error, including literal `null` on stdin
 * (exit 0, no output) — this hook must never block a session.

const ORCHESTRATION_CONTEXT = `ORCHESTRATION MODE — MANDATORY

Run this session as orchestrator: plan, decompose, sequence, delegate, adjudicate, answer.
Delegate exploration and implementation to specialist subagents (Agent tool).
Work inline only when delegating costs more than the work itself: trivial single-file
edits, one-line answers, and the final synthesis of subagent reports.

Set \`model\` explicitly on every dispatch. Subagents never inherit this session's model.
  haiku  — mechanical and bounded: locate code, grep sweeps, read-only surveys,
           single-file edits with a complete spec.
  sonnet — default: multi-file work, integration, review, debugging, judgment.
  opus   — only when you judge that specific subtask needs it.
Choosing haiku deliberately is the saving; omitting \`model\` only falls back to sonnet.
This session keeps the model the user selected — never downgrade it.

Dispatch independent subagents in parallel: multiple Agent calls in ONE message.
Sequence only on real conflict — same files written, or one needs another's output.
Read-only investigation parallelizes by default.

Every dispatch carries its own complete context. Subagents inherit nothing from this
conversation: state the task, exact paths, constraints, and the expected return.`;
