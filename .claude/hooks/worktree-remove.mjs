 * WorktreeRemove hook. Fires on worktree cleanup (session exit without

 *
 * stdin (WorktreeRemoveHookInput, per the installed @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk
 * sdk.d.ts): {hook_event_name:"WorktreeRemove", worktree_path: string, cwd, ...}.
 * NOTE the field is `worktree_path` (snake_case), not `path`.
 *
 * Deliberately does not delete the branch — only the worktree checkout.
 * Deleting a branch is a destructive, out-of-scope action (it may hold real
 * commits); that decision is left to the user/agent.
