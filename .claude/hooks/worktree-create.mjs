/**
 * Worktree seed hook — WorktreeCreate + PostToolUse:EnterWorktree.
 *
 * WorktreeCreate stdin (WorktreeCreateHookInput): {hook_event_name:"WorktreeCreate",
 * name, cwd, ...}. This is a "type":"command" hook — Claude Code's native
 * `git worktree add` is replaced entirely once this is wired; on success this
 * hook must print the absolute worktree path as a BARE string on stdout (no
 * JSON — that shape is only for "type":"http"/"callback" hooks, per the
 * WorktreeCreateHookSpecificOutput doc comment in the installed
 * @anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk sdk.d.ts).
 *
 * PostToolUse stdin with tool_name "EnterWorktree" (PostToolUseHookInput):
 * {hook_event_name:"PostToolUse", tool_input:{name|path}, cwd, ...} — fires on
 * every EnterWorktree call, including entry into a worktree that already
 * existed. Used here as an idempotent re-seed safety net. PostToolUse's
 * schema has no bare-path convention: this path stays silent (empty stdout)
 * once seeding is done or was never needed, and emits a JSON
 * additionalContext notice instead while a claimed seed is still running.

//
// `git rev-parse` failing here should be rare (the worktree was just
// verified to exist above), but an empty result must never fall through
// straight to an UNCOORDINATED spawn: WorktreeCreate followed immediately
// by PostToolUse:EnterWorktree would then spawn two seeders with no claim

// tree (which would show up in `git status`).

// The guess is NOT trustworthy by name alone: git deduplicates colliding
// worktree admin-dir basenames (confirmed empirically) — if some OTHER
// worktree elsewhere in this repo already has a directory basename of
// `name`, THAT one keeps the plain `<root>/.git/worktrees/<name>` and ours

// read `status:"done"` there. Every worktree admin dir carries its own
// `gitdir` file (git's own bookkeeping) naming the exact worktree `.git`
// file it belongs to; only trust the guess once that file confirms it
// points back at THIS worktree's own `.git`. A mismatch, or a missing/
// unreadable `gitdir` file, means the guess is unusable.
//

// does this degrade to spawning unconditionally with no state file — safe
