/**
 * Worktree session context (SessionStart). Fires once when a session begins.
 *
 * Reads `event.cwd` — the session's current working directory at start time.
 * If the cwd is inside a git worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<name>`), injects
 * additionalContext so the main session agent knows it must read/write files
 * inside the worktree path, not the project root.
 *
 * Uses `event.cwd` directly (no state files needed): Claude Code propagates the
 * dynamic cwd into every hook event, so this hook is always current.
 *
 * No-op when cwd is the project root or any non-worktree path.
 * Always exits 0 (fail-open).
