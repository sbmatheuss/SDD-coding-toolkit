/**
 * Worktree write guard (PreToolUse / Write|Edit|MultiEdit). Fires before any
 * file write/edit.
 *
 * Reads `event.cwd` — Claude's dynamic current working directory. If the cwd
 * is inside a git worktree (`.claude/worktrees/<name>`) but the target file is
 * outside that worktree, returns permissionDecision:"ask" so the agent confirms
 * with the user before proceeding. This catches the common failure mode where a
 * long session causes the agent to forget it should operate inside the worktree
 * and accidentally writes absolute paths pointing to the project root.
 *
 * Uses `event.cwd` directly (no state files): Claude Code propagates the
 * dynamic cwd into every hook event, so detection is always current.
 *
 * No-op when cwd is the project root or any non-worktree path. Also no-op
 * for writes into Claude Code's own per-session scratchpad, which by design
 * lives outside every worktree.
 * Always exits 0 (never hard-blocks: "ask" lets the user decide).
